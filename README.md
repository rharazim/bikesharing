## Overview
After our trip to New York City, we were so impressed with the bikesharing program that we decided to start a company that would do the same in our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. But before we can get to starting the company, we have to pitch our idea to a group of angel investors. To do this, we needed to analyze a bit of bikesharing data and adequately visualize the data to present our case to the potential investors. We decided that Tableau would be the best tool to create these visualizations.

## Results

### Checkout Times: 
This line graph shows the number bike rides and how long each ride lasted. We can see that most rides are under one hour long, and the most frequent ride length is about five minutes. This means we should have bike sharing stations about five minutes away from each other for the convenience of the users. 

### Checkout Times by Gender:
This graph is similar to the previous one, but now it has been sorted by gender. We see that males are the most frequent users.

### Trips by Weekday:
This is a heatmap of bike usage sorted by days of the week and hours of each day. During weekdays, 7am to 9am and 4pm to 7pm are the most frequent trip times. On weekends, trip times are spread more evenly from 9am to 7pm. 

### Trips by Gender:
This graph separates the heatmaps for all three gender categories: Male, Female and Unknown. These heatmaps are consistent with the previous section and that proportional usage is not much different across genders. 

### Usertype Trips by Gender and Weekday:
This graph shows that subscribers are most active on weekdays, while one-time customers are using the bikes mostly on weekends. The subscribers may be using the bikes to get to and from their place of employment, while one-time customers may be using the bikes to sightsee on weekends. This highlights two different demographics: NYC residents and tourists.

### August Peak Hours:
This bar graph shows the number of rides per hour of the day, and we see that 8am and 5pm are the most active times of the day for bike rides. Also, the least active are the hours between 2am and 5am, so this is where we should dedicate our maintenance time.

### Top Starting Locations:
This map shows how close bike stations are to each other and the frequency of each station as a starting point. It would be best for bike stations to be located near tourist locations but also residential areas. 

## Summary
Our analysis has brought us a few new revelations that will help shape our bikesharing program for our own city. First of all, the demographic for bikesharing leans heavily toward males, so marketing can be directed toward that demographic moreso than female. Additionally, we need bikes to be available during peak hours for each day of the week. So, on weekdays bikes should be available from 7am to 9am and from 4pm to 7pm to allow subscribers a way to get to and from work. Next, One-time customers tend to use the bikes on weekends from 10am to 7pm. If we were to continue this analysis, we should add a couple more visualizations including: The starting and ending latitude and longitude compared to tourist destinations in the city, and the trip duration for each day of the week.
